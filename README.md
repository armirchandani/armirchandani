👋 Hi there!
I'm Aastha Mirchandani, a driven and curious student at the University of San Francisco, majoring in Business Analytics and minoring in Computer Science. I’m passionate about using data to tell compelling stories, solve real-world problems, and fuel innovation—particularly in the areas of FinTech, commercial real estate, and technology-driven finance.

My academic journey has been shaped by a desire to bridge the gap between data, business, and impact. Through a blend of coursework and hands-on projects, I’ve gained experience in data analytics, machine learning, and full-stack development. I enjoy building tools, visualizations, and models that not only work but also make sense to people.

I’m actively involved in student-led initiatives and professional enrichment programs that empower underrepresented students in finance and tech. I also participate in research and volunteer work focused on social equity and education. These experiences fuel my belief that inclusive innovation can drive meaningful change especially when backed by strong data and a clear mission.
